# Getting Started with ecommerce-store
This project is currently in progress

A live demo of this project can be found at https://chukevh.github.io/kevs-shirt-shop *Currently not working*


## Available Scripts

Currently this project has two parts:
The frontend server written in ReactJS, and the backend server containing all APIs written in NodeJS

In the project directory, you can open up the server fold and run:

### `npm run server`

Runs the backend server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

The server will be ready to make API calls once it is connected to a MongoDB


After running the backend server you can start the frontend project using:

### `npm start`

Runs the React app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

This will start the frontend server and load the website only once the backend server has established a connection.
