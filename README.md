# Getting Started with ecommerce-store
This project is currently in progress.

*Not all features are working*

A live demo of this project can be found [here](http://kevshirtshop.com/)


## Available Scripts

Currently this project has two parts:
The frontend server written in ReactJS, and the backend server containing all APIs written in NodeJS. 
Note the backend server connects to a MongoDB database to pull all the data.

In the project directory, you can open up the server fold and run:

### `npm run server`

Runs the backend server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

The server will be ready to make API calls once it is connected to a MongoDB.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

This will also load the website and once the backend server has established a connection to the Mongo Database.
